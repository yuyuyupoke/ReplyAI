This is a test file to verify the AI context tracking workflow.

Created: 2026-01-09
Purpose: End-to-end testing of git hooks and branch management

Features tested:
1. Branch creation with auto_feature_branch.sh
2. Pre-commit hook (capture changes)
3. Commit-msg hook (add message)
4. Post-commit hook (finalize entry)
5. Merge workflow
6. Post-merge hook (create rollback point)

Expected results:
- commit_log.json should contain this commit
- branch_history.json should track branch creation and merge
- rollback_points.json should have a checkpoint after merge
